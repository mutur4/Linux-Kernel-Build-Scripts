### Linux-Kernel-Build-Scripts
`kernel-build.sh`  - can be used to download a Linux Kernel whose version is provided. The script will also update the Kernel with a set of configurations *(the config file can be update with custom configurations that you might require)*. A final compilation is then made to build the Kernel Image. 

`bzimage-to-vmlinux.sh` - This script can be used to convert the built `bzImage` to a `vmlinux` binary file to be used for debugging.
